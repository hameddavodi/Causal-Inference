### Causal Inference 

Welcome to the Causal Inference Repository! If you're interested in learning more about causal inference, this online resource is the perfect place to start. It covers everything from simple practices like ATE (average treatment effect) and LATE (local average treatment effect), to more advanced methods used in fields like economics, political science, epidemiology, and social policy.

ATE, or average treatment effect, is a measure used in causal inference to estimate the overall impact of a treatment on an outcome of interest. It simply compares the outcomes of those who received the treatment with those who did not.

ATT, or average treatment effect on the treated, is a similar measure that focuses specifically on the population that received the treatment. This allows for a more nuanced understanding of the treatment's impact on this particular group.

LATE, or local average treatment effect, is a measure that takes into account the fact that the effect of a treatment may vary depending on the characteristics of the individuals receiving it. LATE estimates the impact of a treatment for a specific subgroup of the population, based on their "compliance" or willingness to receive the treatment under different circumstances.

Marginal ATE, or marginal average treatment effect, is a measure that estimates the impact of a treatment at the margin or at the marginally treated population. It is useful when the treatment is assigned beyond a binary choice and there are units for whom the treatment can be partially assigned.

All these measures are important tools for understanding the causal relationship between a treatment and an outcome, and for evaluating the effectiveness of interventions in various fields of study.
